SPX 0DTE strategy means trading SPX weekly options (`SPXW`) that expires the same day (a.k.a 0 days to expiration)

Usually, we open credit spread positions between `9:50-12:00 A.M EST` (`6:50 to 9:00 A.M PST`) and we close them before the market closes the same day around `4:00 P.M EST`.

**NOTE**: SPX option is different than SPX weekly option

- SPX options are `AM-settled` options that expire monthly on the third Friday.
- SPX weekly options are `PM-settled` that expire daily after market close.

The `0dte` strategy only applies to SPX weekly options.

## **Why SPX 0DTE strategy?**

- SPX weekly options expire every day. It means you can trade every day.
- SPX weekly options is highly liquid, you can often execute trades at the prices you want.
- SPX weekly options uses the SPX price when the market closes at `4:00 P.M EST` to settle. This is very different than stock options, which bears overnight risk (e.g. after hour price movement could lead to options assignment)
- SPX weekly options is cash settled, meaning no risk of getting assigned with stocks
- Tax benefit: any gains/losses are subject to different tax treatment–60% long-term and 40% short-term.
- Well-defined risk exposure. Never worry about “blowing up” when the market makes a huge move (assuming appropriate position size)
- Small account size. You can start to trade this strategy with only $500
